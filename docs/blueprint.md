## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming, trustworthy blue (#64B5F6) to instill confidence and security in the automated attendance system. This color also alludes to technology and forward-thinking.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF), providing a clean and non-distracting backdrop to highlight the interface elements.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#9575CD) to draw attention to interactive elements such as buttons, notifications, and highlighted attendance records.
- Clean, modern, sans-serif font.
- Simple, outline-style icons for clarity.
